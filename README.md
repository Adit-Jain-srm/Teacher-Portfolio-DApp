  --network devnet
```

## üìä Portfolio Structure

### NFT Attributes

Each teacher portfolio NFT contains:

```json
{
  "name": "Teacher Name",
  "description": "Teaching Portfolio for [Name]",
  "image": "ipfs://QmImageHash",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "Subject",
      "value": "Mathematics"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Students Taught",
      "value": 150
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Years Experience",
      "value": 5
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Impact Score",
      "value": 750
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Verified",
      "value": true
    }
  ],
  "properties": {
    "bio": "Teaching philosophy and approach",
    "achievements": ["Award 1", "Award 2"],
    "education": "Educational background",
    "specializations": ["Algebra", "Geometry"]
  }
}
```

### Impact Score Calculation

The impact score is calculated as:
```
Impact Score = Students Taught √ó Years Experience
```

This provides a simple but meaningful metric for teaching impact.
